Hello! You've stumbled upon the initial version of the renovated Grandis Library. This version of Grandis Library was built using just React. However, eventually, the project transition over to Next JS.

Now, this repo is used to store the json for the class data that appears on the site's class overviews.

You can find the current repo here [Grandis Library NEXT](https://github.com/ikasuu/grandislibrary-next). This is the one which is currently being built and hosted.

Fun tidbit, the original OG site was built using SquareSpace!

Thanks for visiting !! :>
